/**
 * @file flag--shop.tpl.php
 * Contour's theme implementation to display a shop flag link, and a message after the action
 * is carried out.
 *
 * Available variables:
 *
 * - $flag: The flag object itself. You will only need to use it when the
 *   following variables don't suffice.
 * - $flag_name_css: The flag name, with all "_" replaced with "-". For use in 'class'
 *   attributes.
 * - $flag_classes: A space-separated list of CSS classes that should be applied to the link.
 *
 * - $action: The action the link is about to carry out, either "flag" or "unflag".
 * - $status: The status of the item; either "flagged" or "unflagged".
 *
 * - $link_href: The URL for the flag link.
 * - $link_text: The text to show for the link.
 * - $link_title: The title attribute for the link.
 *
 * - $message_text: The long message to show after a flag action has been carried out.
 * - $after_flagging: This template is called for the link both before and after being
 *   flagged. If displaying to the user immediately after flagging, this value
 *   will be boolean TRUE. This is usually used in conjunction with immedate
 *   JavaScript-based toggling of flags.
 *
 * Template suggestions available, listed from the most specific template to
 * the least. Drupal will use the most specific template it finds:
 * - flag--name.tpl.php
 * - flag--link-type.tpl.php
 *
 * NOTE: This template spaces out the <span> tags for clarity only. When doing some
 * advanced theming you may have to remove all the whitespace.
